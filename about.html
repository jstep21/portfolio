            <p>Hi, I'm Jake, a passionate software engineer specializing in web development. I love building solutions that bridge creativity and technology. As a developer, my mission is to create innovative, user-friendly experiences that make a difference.</p>
            <p>Originally from the D.C metropolitan area, I discovered my love for coding while learning from begineer tutorial videos. After completing Tech Elevator's Java Bootcamp, I transitioned into software engineering, where I've had the chance to work on exciting projects. When I'm not coding, I really enjoy music and playing my guitar, which fuels my creativity.</p>
            <p>Professionally, I graduated from UMBC with a degree in Business Technology Administration. Since then, I've worked with a tech company in the alcohol/beverage industry, where I contributed to managing their product database. Following this role, I've developed skills in Python and Java, helping businesses improve processes and deliver innovative solutions. I thrive on turning complex problems into clean, efficient code.</p>
            <p>I'm passionate about using technology to solve problems and improve lives. I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my skills and take on new challenges. Whether it's working with teams or diving into solo projects, I'm driven by a desire to continuously learn and grow.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, I'm excited to continue evolving as a developer. My long-term goal is to contribute to impactful projects and collaborate with innovative teams. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities that will allow me to grow personally and professionally. One day, I hope to launch my own product.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio, and if you'd like to collaborate or chat, you can email me here: jstephens1215@gmail.com. I'm always open to new opportunitiesâ€”let's work together to create something amazing!</p>
